# algorithms-in-python
A place to show and explain algorithms and data structures with python

- All concepts are explained within the python code files(*.py)
- All code files are written in python 3.6
- I recommend to view all files in an IDE such as IDLE or pycharm so as to read the comments and test the code with your inputs
- To run from terminal use, python3 <filename>.py
  - example python3 gcd_python.py
